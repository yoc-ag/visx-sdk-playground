                  JAR`s
###########################################

There are 2 types of jars that are supported:

== Input Jar ==

This is the jar that bindings should be generated for.

For example, if you were binding the Google Maps library, this would
be Google's "maps.jar".

Set the build action for these jars in the properties page to "InputJar".


== Reference Jars ==

These are jars that are referenced by the input jar.  C# bindings will
not be created for these jars.  These jars will be used to resolve
types used by the input jar.

NOTE: Do not add "android.jar" as a reference jar.  It will be added automatically
based on the Target Framework selected.

Set the build action for these jars in the properties page to "ReferenceJar".

                  AAR`s
###########################################

There are 2 types of aars that are supported:

== Main Aar ==

This is the aar that bindings should be generated for.

For example, if you were binding the Google Maps library, this would
be Google's "maps.aar".

Set the build action for these jars in the properties page to "LibraryProjectZip".


== Reference Aars ==

These are aars that are referenced by the input aar.  C# bindings will
not be created for these aars.  These aars will be used to resolve
types used by the input aar.

NOTE: Add "android.aar" as a reference aar.  It wont be added automatically
based on the Target Framework selected. Download and add manually.

Set the build action for these aars in the properties page to "EmbeddedReferenceJar".
